## Introduction

In this project, we explore the use of a Patricia Tree (also known as a radix tree) to efficiently search for words within texts. Patricia Trees are a specialized form of trie that optimizes memory usage and search time. This project aims to enhance your skills in designing, implementing, and analyzing data structures.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project include:

- Implementing a Patricia Tree data structure.
- Developing algorithms to insert words into the tree.
- Designing efficient search algorithms to retrieve words from texts.
- Providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the Patricia Tree.

## Patricia Tree

A Patricia Tree is a compact trie structure that stores keys (words) in a tree format. It is particularly useful for applications like text search and IP routing. The tree's nodes have variable-length keys and are compressed to minimize memory usage. This project focuses on creating an efficient text search mechanism using Patricia Trees.

## Implementation Details

- Each node in the Patricia Tree represents a portion of a word.
- Nodes are linked based on their common prefixes, leading to efficient memory usage.
- Search algorithms exploit the tree's structure to quickly locate words in texts.

## Performance

Patricia Trees offer efficient performance characteristics:

- Memory-efficient storage due to shared prefixes.
- O(m) time complexity for search operations, where m is the average length of words.
- Efficient insertion and deletion operations.
